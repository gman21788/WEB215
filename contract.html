		<h2>Course Contract</h2>
		<p>I, <a href='/introduction.html'>Garrett C. Jordan</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2022 WEB215-N801 Advanced Markup and Scripting class with my instructor D.I. von Briesen.</p>
		<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world.  I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
		<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendence, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as an absence.</p>
		<p>Signed: Garrett C. Jordan, 16 January 2022</p>
